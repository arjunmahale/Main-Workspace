// 
Daemon threads are background threads.

They die automatically when all non-daemon (main/user) threads finish.

So, if your main thread finishes before the daemon thread executes, the JVM shuts down, and the daemon thread is killed without printing anything.


ðŸ’¡ What is a Daemon Thread in Java?
A daemon thread is a background thread that runs in service of user (non-daemon) threads. It's designed to perform supportive or housekeeping tasks, such as:

Garbage collection

Background monitoring

Auto-saving

Logging

Cleanup activities

âœ… Key Properties of Daemon Threads:
Property	Description
Background Thread	->Runs in the background
Dies Automatically->	JVM kills all daemon threads when no user threads are alive
Low Priority	->Often lower in priority than user threads
Not Meant for Critical Tasks	->Should not hold important business logic or data processing
